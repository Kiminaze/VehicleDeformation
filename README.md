# VehicleDeformation

This is a small resource that allows saving and reapplying of vehicle bodywork deformation. It also 
features full synchronization of the damage between all players. No more weird situations where 
other players cannot see the damage on your vehicle!

Fully compatible to my paid script [AdvancedParking](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-advancedparking-prevents-despawns/2099582) 
where you can park any vehicle anywhere in the world.
